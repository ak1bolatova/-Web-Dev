    <h1>Travel to China</h1>

    <strong> <h4>List of places you must visit</h4></strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Great Wall</li>
        <li> Forbidden City</li>
        <li>Avatar mountains</li>
        
        </ul>
     <strong> <h4>Intersting information</h4></strong> 
     <p class="text">China is one of the world’s oldest civilizations, with over 5,000 years of history, yet it’s also one of the most futuristic countries on Earth.<br>

China is the most populous country in the world, home to more than 1.4 billion people, and it has 56 officially recognized ethnic groups, each with its own traditions, clothing, and cuisine.<br>

The country is famous for the Great Wall of China, which stretches over 21,000 kilometers. Contrary to a popular myth, it cannot be seen from space with the naked eye—but it remains one of the greatest engineering achievements in history.<br>

China is also the birthplace of many important inventions, including paper, printing, gunpowder, and the compass, often called the Four Great Inventions. These discoveries changed the course of global history.<br></p>
 <strong> <h4 id="food">Chinesee food</h4></strong> 
     <p class="text">Chinese food is one of the most diverse and influential cuisines in the world. There is no single “Chinese cuisine” — instead, it is made up of many regional food traditions, each with its own flavors, ingredients, and cooking styles.

One of the most famous is Sichuan cuisine, known for its bold, spicy taste and the unique “numbing” sensation from Sichuan pepper. Dishes like mapo tofu and hot pot come from this region.

Cantonese cuisine focuses on fresh ingredients and light flavors. It is famous for dim sum, such as dumplings, buns, and rolls, often eaten with tea. This style is very popular around the world.

Northern Chinese food uses more wheat-based products like noodles, pancakes, and dumplings. In contrast, southern China prefers rice, rice noodles, and lighter dishes.</p>
